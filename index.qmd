# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a thematic module example that supports the development of digital twins within the [interTwin](https://www.intertwin.eu) project. 

On this page we showcase openEOs standardization of remote sensing and Earth observation operations. We do this by translating the flood mapping algorithm as presented in @bauer-marschallinger_satellite-based_2022, and part of the [GloFAS Global Flood Monitoring](https://www.globalfloods.eu/technical-information/glofas-gfm/) to the [openEO](https://openeo.org/) syntax of the Python Client. This algorithm employs Sentinel-1 backscattered microwaves, so-called "sigma nought" or $\sigma^0$, to detect flooding. In this exercise we will replicate the case study of the above mentioned paper, the February 2018 flooding of the Greek region of Thessaly.
