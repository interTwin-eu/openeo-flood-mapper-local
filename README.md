# openeo-flood-mapper

## Description
This project represents a workflow retrieving flooded surfaces from intensity (backscatter) data of Sentinel-1. The
workflow is developed as part of the [interTwin](https://www.intertwin.eu) project by the Department of Geodesy and Geoinformation at the Technische Universit√§t Wien, as part of an interdisiplinary Digital Twin Engine (DTE). This workflow is based on the **openEO** syntax.

The current workflow uses openEO locally and remotely and provides [Python scripts](src/openeo_flood_mapper_local/) to prepare and view the data for this purpose. Additionally, the workflow is represented and described in the dedicated 
[notebooks](https://github.com/interTwin-eu/openeo-flood-mapper-local/blob/main/notebooks/1_yeoda_dc.ipynb) and the accompanying website: https://intertwin-eu.github.io/openeo-flood-mapper-local/.
