# openeo-flood-mapper (local)

## Description
This project represents a workflow retrieving flooded surfaces from intensity (backscatter) data of Sentinel-1. The
workflow is developed as part of the **interTwin** project by the **Technische Universit√§t Wien**. As part of an 
interdisiplinary Digital Twin Engine (DTE) it is built based on the **openEO** syntax.

The current workflow uses openEO locally and provides [Python scripts](src/openeo_flood_mapper_local/) to prepare the 
input data for this purpose. Additionally, the workflow is represented and described in the dedicated 
[notebooks](notebooks/1_yeoda_dc.qmd) and the accompanying website: https://intertwin-eu.github.io/openeo-flood-mapper-local/.
